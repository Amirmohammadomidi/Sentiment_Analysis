# Task Description 

- We want to solve a typical supervised learning problem
- Given text at the input, we want to generate labels as output
- Data comes from a subset of SST-2 dataset, which is a sentiment classification dataset
- Dataset is divided into train and test sets. You can access and download them via the
links
- You should access the files and analyze samples in this dataset, using Google Colab
platform
- Check data distribution, labels, etc.
- Particularly, you have to do a prediction task for sentiment
- Probably do some data preparation methods on data for input and output! And other
procedures you have learned from courses or other sources about NLP and deep
learning
- Use a LLM as the core of your model in order to solve the task, for instance you can look
at BERT, RoBERTa, BART, T5, Flan-T5, etc.
- Design of the model(s) is up to you. You can change model structure, tune
hyperparameters and use any other method (based on your previous knowledge of deep
learning and NLP) to improve the results
- Training and inference are essential parts of this assignment
- You should adopt one or more suitable evaluation metrics to measure the quality of
predictions
- You should simply train your model on the train data, and then use the test data to
measure the quality of predictions on unseen samples
- Analysis of predictions is necessary, such as using confusion matrix
- Clean code is always appreciated 
- After you have done the tasks, you should be able to present your work 
- For necessary questions, you can contact me at my Telegram or Skype account
